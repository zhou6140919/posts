# Design of Hydrogen-Rich Cup Based on Titanium Dioxide Nanotubes

- **A hydrogen-rich cup is designed to electrolyze water and generate hydrogen through platinum-titanium electrodes.**
- **Realize the overall circuit structure on Arduino, including electrolysis circuit, hydrogen detection circuit and control system.**
- **Receive the Bluetooth signal of the mobile phone through the Bluetooth serial port module.**
- **Added two vibrating motors to improve electrolysis efficiency.**
- **Made an application program adapted to the Android system, users can control the cup through the application to achieve heating or timing functions.**
