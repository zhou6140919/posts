# Image Segmentation and Color Mixing 3D Printing

 - **Designed a 3D printer algorithm that supports multi-directional, color mixing, and gradient color printing, and realized a color 3D printing technology that can automatically adjust model segmentation.**
 - **Considering the color-divided model entered by the user, the division plane is adjusted through an algorithm, and the model is divided into multiple sub-blocks, which are printed sequentially by using the rotation of the platform, which greatly reduces the use of support materials and improves material utilization, model strength and surface quality.**
 - **During color mixing, materials are heated at the print head to recognize incoming G-code files and mixed in specific proportions to produce materials of different colors. There is no need to replace nozzles and materials during the printing process, and it can be formed at one time.**
