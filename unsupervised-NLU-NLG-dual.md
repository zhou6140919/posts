# Towards Unsupervised Language Understanding and Generation by Joint Dual Learning

<!-- more -->

## Introduction

**Motivation**

In modular dialogue systems NLU and NLG are two critical components. However, he dual property between understanding and generation has been rarely explored. The prior work still learned both components in a *supervised* manner.

**Contribution**

 - This paper proposes a general learning framework using the duality between NLU and NLG, where *supervised* and *unsupervised* learning can be flexibly incorporated for joint training.
 - This work is the first attempt to exploit the dual relationship between NLU and NLG towards unsupervised learning.
 - The benchmark experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
